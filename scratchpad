Capital gains
Get rid of SavingsAccountYear initializers
Clean up _SavingsAccountYearTest

Fix primitive obsession

Consider what to do about withdrawing more than the starting balance -- assert that this is impossible?
Fix SavingsAccountYearTest.newAccount abstraction -- use it or don't
We're passing in capitalGainsTaxRate everywhere -- put it in constructor?
Eliminate totalWithdrawnExceptCapitalGains()?
